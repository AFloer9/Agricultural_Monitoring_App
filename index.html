        <h2>Intro: will have something better later</h2>

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Our Small-Scale Agricultural Monitoring Project will involve a full tech stack, from the construction of an interactive website on the front end to a SQL database at the back end. Local environmental and agriculturally useful data will be collected both from relevant site APIs (application programming interfaces) and by web scraping for more specific sites. “Hyperlocal” microclimate data will be collected by various sensors placed on the user’s property and connected to an Arduino, for the user that desires extremely specific data about their own crops or garden. Both sensor and scraped data will be added to dynamic databases to be routed locally or through a cloud server and on to the user interface website. Our overall goal is to make it easier for the user to oversee the care of their plants without needing to physically inspect them on a daily basis. Our project will also aid the user in making environmentally friendly decisions regarding use of resources, water being foremost. For an example, if rainfall occurred in the user’s locality, a request to check soil moisture could let the user know whether they needed to irrigate. The website would also assist the user in seasonal crop planning short and long term, by scraping and relating historical data about weather conditions and even averaging this with the microclimate data to get a detailed picture of the optimal times to perform various agricultural tasks like fertilization, irrigation, seed collection, and preparing for frost.
